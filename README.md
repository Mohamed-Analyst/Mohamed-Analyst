👋 Hi, I’m @Mohamed-Analyst (but my friends call me the "Spreadsheet Whisperer").
👀 I’m interested in solving mysteries—especially the kind hiding in data.
🌱 I’m currently learning how to make dashboards so cool they’d make even Excel jealous.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects where data meets creativity (and coffee is involved).
📫 How to reach me: Just yell "Data!" three times, or use LinkedIn/email like a normal person.
😄 Pronouns: He/Him 
⚡ Fun fact: I once spent 3 hours fixing a typo in my code, only to realize it was a semicolon's fault.
